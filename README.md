# Virtual Beer Experience MVP

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a web-based "virtual beer drinking" experience.

## Goal

To create a simple, engaging, and fun mobile web application that simulates the experience of drinking a virtual beer by utilizing the device's motion sensors.

## How it Works

Users visit a webpage on their mobile device. They will see a virtual glass of beer. As they tilt their phone forward (as if taking a drink), the beer level in the virtual glass will decrease, accompanied by a "glugging" sound.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** For the structure of the page.
*   **CSS:** For styling the glass, beer, and layout.
*   **JavaScript:** For handling device orientation sensor input, updating the beer level, and playing sound effects.

## Core Features (MVP)

*   Visual representation of a glass of beer.
*   Tilt-based interaction using device motion sensors (`DeviceOrientationEvent`).
*   Visual feedback: Beer level decreases with forward tilt.
*   Auditory feedback: "Glugging" sound plays as beer level decreases.

This MVP is designed for rapid development and concept validation on mobile web browsers.
